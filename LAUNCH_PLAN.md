# How to Notify Your Waitlist on Launch Day

When you are ready to launch LabelSafe, you will have a list of emails (either in Formspree or Google Sheets). Here is how to email them all at once without getting marked as spam.

### Option 1: The Professional Way (Recommended)
Use an Email Marketing Service. Most have free tiers for < 1000 contacts.

1.  **Export Your List**:
    *   **Formspree**: Go to your Formspree dashboard > Submissions > Export.
    *   **Google Sheets**: File > Download > Comma Separated Values (.csv).
2.  **Sign Up for a Service**:
    *   **Brevo (formerly Sendinblue)**: Great free plan (300 emails/day).
    *   **Mailchimp**: Classic choice, free for up to 500 contacts.
    *   **ConvertKit**: Good for creators.
3.  **Import Contacts**: Upload your CSV file to the service.
4.  **Create Campaign**: Design a nice email with your App Store link.
5.  **Send!**

### Option 2: The Direct Way (For small lists < 50)
If you only have a few dozen signups, you can email them yourself.

1.  Open your email client (Gmail/Outlook).
2.  Compose a new email.
3.  **IMPORTANT**: Put your own email in the **To** field.
4.  Put all the waitlist emails in the **BCC** field.
    *   *Why BCC?* So people don't see each other's email addresses. This protects their privacy.
5.  Write your message and send.
